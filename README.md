# 📊 Advanced Pandas GroupBy & Aggregation Analysis

This repository contains an **advance-level Pandas project** focused on **GroupBy operations, aggregations, and analytical techniques** commonly used in real-world data analysis.
The project builds upon Pandas fundamentals and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to demonstrate **how meaningful insights are extracted from data using aggregation logic**.

---

## 🧠 Project Motivation

After learning:
- Pandas Basics
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

the next critical step is learning **how to summarize, compare, and analyze data efficiently**.

This project is designed to:
- strengthen understanding of 'groupby()' operations
- demonstrate real-world analytical thinking

## 📊 Dataset Information

- **Dataset:** Tips Dataset
- **Source:** Seaborn built-in dataset
- **Domain:** Restaurant / Business Analytics

### Dataset Features:
- Total bill amount
- Tip amount
- Customer attributes
- Dining day and time
- Party size

The dataset is loaded directly from a Python library, so **no manual download is required**.
